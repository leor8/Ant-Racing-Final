A two player platformer game where each player controls an ant avatar and try to reach the top of the map before the opponent. Along the way, players can pick up powerups to move faster, jump higher or slow down the enemy. There are also snowstorms that can hit ant and freezes the ant. So get ready to the beat your opponent and show him/her how good you are!
